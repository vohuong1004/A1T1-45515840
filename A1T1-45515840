Question 1:
- Step 1: Save twain.txt from ilearn into Downloads
- Step 2 : Use scp to upload file twain.txt into my AWS account:
scp -i 45515840.pem twain.txt ubuntu@ec2-52-63-147-126.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com:
- Step 3: Convert all instances of the string ‘Huck’ to ‘HucK’:
* Use command: sed 's/Huck/HucK/g' twain.txt
* Check the number of the string ‘Huck’ in result file = 0:
     Use: sed 's/Huck/HucK/g' twain.txt>test.txt
          grep -c 'Huck' test.txt
          
Question 2:
- Step 1: Use IDLE editor to create and edit the program . To start editing a program, go to the menu item File→New Window
then enter the code of question into the editor window and save it as userargument.py into Downloads.
- Step 2: Execute userargument.py with the command line:
a) python userargument.py python
Result: Hi, python. How are you?
b) python userargument.py @!&^%
Result: -bash: !: event not found
c) python userargument.py 1234
 Result: Hi, 1234. How are you?
d) python userargument.py Bob
Result: Hi, Bob. How are you?
e) userargument.py Bob
Result: -bash: userargument.py: command not found
f) python userargument.py Alice Bob
Result: Hi, Alice. How are you?

Question 3:
We have every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, 
but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.
- Step 1: Use IDLE editor to create and edit the program. To start editing a program, go to the menu item File→New Window. 
Then type in IDLE the python code to check if the input year is a leap year or not into the editor window and save it as 
Gregorianleapyear.py into Downloads.
* The python code in IDLE:
year=int(input("Enter a year: "))
if (year % 4)==0:
    if (year % 100)==0:
        if (year % 400)==0:
            print("%d is a leap year." %(year))
        else:
            print("%d is not a leap year." %(year))
    else:
        print("%d is a leap year." %(year))
else:
    print("%d is not a leap year." %(year))
- Step 2: Checking with the year 2020

Question 4:
-  Step 1 : Composing in IDLE the python program that takes two integers a and b from the command line and writes a random 
integer between a and b into the editor window and save it as rd.py into Downloads.
* Typing in IDLE:
import random
a=int(input("Enter a="))
b=int(input("Enter b="))
if a<b:
    print("The random integer between %d and %d is %d" %(a,b,random.randint(a,b)))
else:
    print("The random integer between %d and %d is %d" %(b,a,random.randint(b,a)))
- Step 2: Checking with a=9 and b=6; a=5 and b=7

Question 6:
-  Step 1 : Composing in IDLE the python program that calculates and writes the amount of money you would have if you invested 
it at a given interest rate (compounded continuously), taking the number of years t, the principal P, and the annual interest 
rate r as command-line arguments. The desired value is given by the formula Pert. Then saving it as invest.py into Downloads
* Typing in IDLE:
print ("[Calculate the desired value]")
import math
rate=float(input("Interest rate compounded continuously r= "))
years=int(input("The number of years t= "))
principal=float(input("The principal P= "))
value=principal*math.e**(rate*years)
print ("After %d years, the desired value will be $%.2f" %(years, value))
-   Step 2: Checking with r=0.25, t=10, P=1000. The result is: 12182.49
